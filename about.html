            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            
            
            <p>This project is developed to tackle the problems faced by organisers of University, Our organisers have a bunch of tasks which includes a task of making aware about the events which are going to be organised in the University and also collecting the information about participants, which is very much time consuming and energy consuming, and this creates challenges such as most of the people get late news about the event and organisers also doesnâ€™t get information about the participants properly to make a proper plan for the event. By offering the <b>Event Management System</b>, this project provides an innovative way to overcome these issues effectively and efficiently.</p>

            <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
            <p>In our Event Management System The problems I have mentioned above can be solved because using our project, Organisers can easily make the people aware about the events which are going to be organised in the University, Organisers can easily get required information about the participants before a fixed time because of this they can easily prepare an effective plan for the event. This project bridges these gaps between the Organisers and the Participants.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>The driving force behind this initiative is to reduce the burdens faced by the Organisers and the participants Duning an Event. We believe that our project will help to reduce stress and difficulties, and this project reflects our commitment to turning that belief into action.</p>
